## Exercise 4 Task 2: Caching policy

In this task, you will explore and apply the caching policy to your API.

Azure API Management can be configured for response caching which can significantly reduce API latency, bandwidth consumption, and web service load for data that does not change frequently.

1. Navigate to **All API's** section in the API management resource. We will now apply caching to the **Colors API** we created in Exercise 3.

1. Go to the **Colors API (1)** and select the **Get random color (2)** call:

1. Under **Inbound processing**, click on **+ Add policy**.

1. Scroll down and select **Cache responses**.

1. Set a caching duration of `15` **(1)** seconds and **Save (2)**.

1. Navigate back to the website and configure the Colors website from Exercise 3(Task 4.2) to use the Unlimited subscription URL.

1. Select **Start**.

1. Notice that for each 15-second period, the same color is set.

    > **Note:** If you are unable to see colors, please refresh the page once.

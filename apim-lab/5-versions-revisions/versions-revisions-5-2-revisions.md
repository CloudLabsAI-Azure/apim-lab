## Exercise 5 Task 2: Create a new revision of an API

In Task 2, you will learn how to create a new revision of an existing API in Azure API Management (APIM). This involves adding a caching policy to improve API performance, testing the changes, and making the new revision the active one. 

### Task 2.1: Add a new revision

1. Navigate back to the **APIM instance**, and select the **Star Wars** API **v2**.

1. Select the **Revisions (1)** tab and click on **+ Add Revision (2)**

      ![APIM Revisions Menu](media/p17t2.1p2.png)
  
1. On the **Create a new revision of Stars Wars v2** window, enter the description as `Adding a caching policy` **(1)** and click on **Create (2)**.

    > The new revision is online but not yet current. The previous revision continues to remain the active default. Having added the new revision has not resulted in any change for your API consumers.

### Task 2.2: Add caching

1. Switch to the **Design** tab, then select the `Get People` operation.
    > **Revision 2** automatically became the active revision you are now making changes in. You can also switch between revisions, but **be aware that changes to the *Current* revision are live immediately**.

1. Navigate to the **Inbound processing** tab.
   
1. Replace the existing policies **(1)** with the below xml to add a 10-second caching policy for the **GET People** operation via the Code editor and click on **Save (2)**

      ![APIM Created Revision](media/mapi51a.png)

    ```xml
      <policies>
            <!-- Throttle, authorize, validate, cache, or transform the requests -->
            <inbound>
            <base />
            <cache-lookup vary-by-developer="false" vary-by-developer-groups="false" allow-private-response-caching="false" must-revalidate="false" downstream-caching-type="none" />
            </inbound>
            <backend>
            <base />
            </backend>
            <outbound>
            <base />
            <cache-store duration="10" />
            </outbound>
      </policies>
    ```
      
      ![APIM Created Revision](media/E5T2.2S3-0209.png)

1. Once the code is updated, the new `cache-policy` will be created.

### Task 2.3: Test the new revision

1. Navigate to the **Test** tab from the top, and click on **Trace** button.
  
     > **Note**: The revision number at the top of the page as well as in the request URL. The request URL should look similar to: `https://<your-apim-name>.azure-api.net/sw/v2;rev=2/people/`.

1. Click on **Send (1)** to test the API twice. Then click on **Trace (2)**, and go to **Trace (3)** tab and scroll down to see that the cache lookup occurred.

### Task 2.4: Make current revision

1. Now, select the **Revisions (1)** tab. Click on the **ellipsis (...)** for `rev2` **(2)** and select the **Make Current (3)** option.

      ![APIM Revision Make Current](media/p17t2.4p1.png)

1. On the **Make revision current** window, check the **Post to the Public Change log for the API (1)** and provide the description as `Adding a caching policy to improve API response time` **(2)**. Click on **Save (3)**.

      ![APIM Revision Make Current](media/E5T2.4S2-0209.png)

1. The new revision is now the current/live one. When you test now, note that the URL no longer contains a specific revision. The old revision is still online and can now be accessed with the `rev` qualifier. 

    > Unlike versioning, revisioning requires no URL updates for the API consumer.

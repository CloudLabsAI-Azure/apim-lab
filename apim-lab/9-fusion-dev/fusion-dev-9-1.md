# Exercise 9: Fusion Dev (Optional)

### Estimated Duration: 30 Minutes

## Overview

In this exercise, you will create a Power Apps Canvas application that uses an Excel worksheet as the primary data source and integrates with the Star Wars API via a custom connector exported from Azure API Management. This application will allow users to view and search for information about Star Wars characters.

## Objectives

In this exercise, you will perform:

- Task 1: Power Apps and APIM
- Task 2: View your custom connector in Power Platform
- Task 3: Generate the Star Wars Fan Club Application
- Task 4: Add the Star Wars API Data Source

### Task 1: Power Apps and APIM

The *premier* Star Wars Fan club is growing and the club officers would like to upgrade from their existing member tracking worksheet to a mobile application that would be available to their members all over the world. The members would also like to see information about their favorite Star Wars movies and characters in the application that would update as new shows and movies are released.

In this exercise, you will be using [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/) with the Azure API Management instance that you created [in part three](../3-adding-apis/adding-apis-3-1-from-scratch.md) of this lab. The Excel worksheet of member profiles will serve as the primary backing data source and will be used to generate a base application. You will export the Star Wars API from Azure API Management as a Power Platform Custom Connector so that the Canvas App can access real-time Star Wars character information.
